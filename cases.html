        <div class="blog-summary">
          <p> <i>Age 27 yrs, Chettypulam, Velanai, Jaffna District. Married with two children. Her experiences in life are shared as follows:</i></p>
            <p>“My husband fled to India in 1990 with his mother and sister.  They lived in the Mandapam Refugee Camp in Tamil Nadu 
                State for a number of years. They returned to Sri Lanka in 2003 during the ceasefire agreement between the government 
                and the L.T.T.E. I married  Balamurugan in 2004, and we were blessed with a son. When hostilities resumed inn 2006 we 
                were forced to flee to India and were placed once again in the Mandapam Refugee Camp where our child was born. </p>
            <p>When the war ended we returned to Sri Lanka in February 2011 and resettled on Velanai Island near Jaffna. But we didn’t 
                have a home - we were living in a hut which belonged to our relatives.   Fortunately, my mother-in-law gave us a small 
                plot of land and we built a temporary hut there. My husband is an experienced fisherman but he doesn't have the proper 
                equipment to fish. As a result, he works as a day labourer.  My mother-in-law makes mats from Palmyra leaves.  Sadly 
                the income we make is still insufficient to cover all our living costs. Our children find it very difficult to study 
                because we are afraid of using the kerosene lamp at night for fear of starting a fire in our small house.  It is difficult 
                to cook as well because there are many of us and at the same time there is also the fear of poisonous insects.</p>
            <p>We are happy that the OfERR Ceylon Jaffna Office came forward to help us by providing a new home and a sewing 
                machine with all the accessories.  This will allow me to sew items which I can sell to earn additional income." </p>

            <h1><a href="#">Empowering Displaced Individuals through Enhanced Documentation Support</a></h1>
          </div>
          <div class="blog-summary">
            <p>Displaced populations often encounter significant challenges related to identity verification and documentation. 
              The Organization for Eelam Refugees Rehabilitation (OfERR), along with its various programs, primarily focuses on 
              addressing this critical issue. By facilitating the acquisition of essential documents, OfERR empowers displaced 
              individuals to pursue education and employment opportunities.</p>
            <p>A compelling case study exemplifies the impact of OfERR’s efforts. Mr. Kesavarajan, born in India in 1987, returned 
              to Sri Lanka in 1993 with the assistance of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) ferry service. 
              Then he married and had two girl children.  Unfortunately, Mr. Kesavarajan lost both his driver’s license and citizenship 
              card, since his work majorly involves driving, he couldn’t able to continue his work. </p>
            <p>After some days only he realized to get his certificates until then he didn’t care about his lost documents.  
              Then he approached Grama Niladhari, since he was born in India, they said that only with the Sri Lankan consular 
              birth certificate and citizenship certificate he can further proceed.  He was stumbled and confused.</p>
            <p>Mr. Kesavarajan came to know that OfERR conducted mobile documentation camps. He then approached the organization, 
              where he received comprehensive guidance throughout the process. Ultimately, he obtained his citizenship card and 
              driver’s license, with financial support from OfERR.</p>
            <p>Now equipped with the necessary documents, Mr. Kesavarajan can continue his work confidently. Moreover, he is actively 
              working with OfERR to secure essential documents for his children. His success underscores the invaluable role played by 
              OfERR in ensuring displaced individuals’ access to essential documentation. Mr. Kesavarajan expresses enduring gratitude 
              for the unwavering support of OfERR. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="blog-summary">
          <p> <i> Age 48 yrs from Allaippiddy, Velanai Island (off the coast of the Jaffna peninsula). Married with three children;  
            engaged in candle production.  She shares her life experience with us:</i></p>
            <p>“In 1990 we were displaced due to the war.  My mother sent me to India with my sister’s family for safety reasons. 
              I stayed at the Viruthachalam Refugee Camp where I had the opportunity of working with OfERR INDIA as a health worker 
              from 1991 to 1995. When we returned to Sri Lanka in 1995 we were assigned to the Vavuniya refugee camp.  Raveendran, 
              who I later married, was also living in the same camp. We now have three children. Initially we were able to manage 
              financially but later, when the children started growing up, it was difficult for us to meet our daily expenses. My 
              husband went to Doha for employment as a minor worker. In 2006 hostilities began again and we once again had to flee 
              to India.  We stayed in the Valaja Camp which was located in the Vellore district.  </p>
            <p>My husband did not accompany us as he was still working in Doha.  He tried to move to another country but he was not 
              successful.  We eventually lost touch with him but with the help of the UNHCR we were able to track him down.  During 
              this period I was diagnosed with cancer and had to undergo surgery.</p>
            <p>In the refugee camp I learnt how to make candles and sandal sticks.  We came back to Sri Lanka to live on our own soil 
              and I started making candles to earn extra income which I could put toward my children's needs. </p>
            <p>My house was old and unlivable in the rainy season.  OfERR Ceylon came to our rescue and repaired the shelter. They 
              also agreed to provide me with new moulds for making larger quantities of candles to enhance our livelihood. I am living 
              a better life now and am very grateful to  OfERR for all their help."</p>

        <div class="blog-summary">
          <p>Mrs Suwrnan Nilanai left Sri Lanka in 1990 due to the unrealistic situation and took shelter in various 
            refugee camps in TamilNadu.In 2015 she married to Mr.Sewarnan and returns to their mother land in 2017.
            When she was in South India she went for a sewing training and worked as a sewing teacher for six months. 
            After she returned from south India she joined as a member of Ananithivu South Women Rural development Society 
            and became a sewing teacher. Her Husband involved farming in their village. And they blessed with Babyboy.</p>
            <p>OfERR Jaffna supported her husband to get citizenship, at that time Nilanini requested to get sewing machine 
              to start tailoring at home. By considering her request and her skills OfERR given tools and equipment for her 
              to start her carrier in 2021 June. At the same time OfERR requested her to consider whenever she gets 
              opportunities to establish her tailoring activities, consider to provide employment for a woman from vulnerable 
              families. OfERR organized for her to get advance skill/ Market strategies technical trainings, Business 
              development coaching and mentoring training.</p>
            <p>Now she has established her tailoring business and given employment opportunity for five women from vulnerable 
              families, under her supervision they have taken orders from various places such as orders to stich uniforms from 
              preschools and schools. Their quality stitching and customer service grabbing more customers and getting number 
              of orders.</p>
            <p>Nilanai opened boutique on a main road of Analithivu, and hanged all their stitched cloths. If the country 
              situation become stable, she will have more orders locally as well from abroad. The Divisional Office of Kayts 
              and the Women Rural Development Society honored her for her initiatives and the support she is giving to the 
              village of Analithivu South.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>Child Protection and Case Management</h3>
        <p>My name is Sumathi age 35. I have received various trainings such as Protection training, gender equality and 
          Sexual gender-based violence prevention training, child protection and health related training through OfERR. 
          I have been a member of the Welcome group formed by OfERR in my village of Kumpurupitiy to welcome returnees and 
          provide them with the necessary registration, Residencial arrangements, and enrollment of children in schools. 
          OfERR then looked after my services and recruited me as a counselor to identify the needs of returnees in the 
          Kuchchaveli area, such as collecting databases and working with relevant government officials on the protection 
          of women and children. Together with the Women Development Officer, Child Protection Officer and Grama Sevakar 
          of the Kuchchaveli Divisional Secretariat, I have been conducting SLRRRP3 project training with Government officials 
          and OfERR Officers to provide awareness training to the people of our area.</p>
        <p>In this situation, a 14-year-old returnee girl from our area and immediately took action to protect the girl when 
          she heard the news that a young man from a neighboring village had tried to abuse her. The matter was immediately 
          reported to the Grama Nilathaari through Kuchchaveli Divisional Child Protection Officer and the team including the
           Health Division took charge of the girl. It is noteworthy that the girl's mother has gone to the Middle East as a 
           housemaid. The incident took place when the girl's father, who was in the care of her father, went to work. We 
           continue to maintain secrecy and take remedial action in this regard. Due to the absence of the mother, we have 
           handed over the responsibility of the girl's Mother’s Sister. The girl's father has also been provided with goat 
           rearing assistance as a livelihood assistance. The girl is under our constant surveillance and protection from his 
           Aunt. She has been safe at home since school was held because of the Covid 19 period. In the safety of the girl, 
           the photo, name and family details are not mentioned here.</p>

      <h3>Well Construction in Trincomalee</h3>
      <p>The Kuchchaveli Divisional Secretary provided permanent housing with government land for 13 returnees in the village 
        of Iranaikeni in the Kuchchaveli Divisional Secretariat Division of the Trincomalee District in response to the OfERR’s 
        involvement in several consultations with the Government to reintegrate the returnees. The need for water to resettle 
        55 people from these 13 families was paramount, for which our SLRRRP 3 project was helpful. Through this project a 
        Common dug well was constructed and handed over by the Divisional Secretary for public use. A Water Conservation 
        Committee has also been set up to monitor water hygiene and maintenance of the returning public who hand over the well. 
        Those who received this assistance received safe water without any shortage of water.</p>
      <h3>Showed the way; We live happily - I am Balakrishnan Mahadevan, Trincomalee</h3>
        <p>My family was also affected by the 1990 war. My parents and I took refuge in India and lived in the Thiruvadavoor 
          refugee camp. Many years passed and I got married to a woman named Krishnaveni in 2007 and lived with three children. 
          I decided to return to the country in view of the future of the children and returned with my family to my wife's 
          sister's house in Trincomalee 2018 with the help of UNHCR. I made my registrations at OFERR and then they found my 
          needs and took the Consular Birth Certificate and Sri Lankan Citizenship Certificate for my children. Having received 
          these documents there is no impediment for my children to continue their education. Not only that they provided school 
          equipment for my children and met their children's educational needs. I confirmed to the government that there was no 
          land house under the guidance of OfERR.  As a result of registering with the Divisional Secretariat of Town & Gravest, 
          in 2019 the government provided 15 parch of land in the village of Iluppakulam, Trincomalee. Following this, a housing 
          project worth Rs. 750,000 / - was obtained by the National Housing development Authority. Due to the political change 
          in the country during that period, the foundation work on the house was suspended on the eve of completion. “As the 
          deity one went to worship came to meet one cross wise” Like this proverb, OfERR came across and helped me who was in 
          despair of being distracted. OfERR Ceylon provided Livelihood support for Carpentry tools worth of 1 Lakes. With that 
          help, I set up a workshop on the land of another relative and started a business. Although I have a lot of plans to 
          raise goats and chickens from the income I get from that business, I have given up the plan of doing other businesses 
          where we already have a relative home without a home. Although the relatives' house, how many days they will stay with 
          us from time to time there are minor disagreements. When we went to the OfERR Ceylon and told them our situation we could 
          not bear these. They talked to the Divisional Secretary and took permission to set up a temporary Shelter and permanent 
          Toilet on the land given to us by the government. I am currently doing my carpentry business and raising chickens on my 
          land.  “Live happily with my family and safely in my own home on my own land in my own Country.” I don’t have to depend 
          on anyone for family expenses and children’s education because I currently have two careers. With that income I added the 
          children to the evening class. I also showed money to pick up the electrical connection to the house. Now we eat three 
          meals a day to our satisfaction. Next, I am saving a little of the income and making arrangements for goat rearing. I 
          will plan with income... I will progress in the economy. I will raise the quality of education of the children.</p>

        <h3>Nothing is impossible if tried says – Thevarasa Pradeepan</h3>
          <p>My name is Thevarasa Pradeepan. Kumburupitiya is a permanent resident of Kuchveli Divisional Secretariat area 
            in Trincomalee district. When I was nine years old, I went to India by boat with my mother, father and 2 brothers 
            by boat from Mannar on 02.05.1990 due to the ethnic riots in my homeland. They took us to Kadayanallur refugee camp 
            in Tenkasi district and registered us there. During my stay in the camp I was educated up to grade 12 as well as 
            going to the daily wages available after the completion of school studies. Thus, while my life was going on, I fell 
            in love with Santhanam Devarani, a resident of my camp in Trincomalee Kanniya village, on 06.07.2000. Both of our 
            daughters studied up to grade 10 in India. My parents and siblings returned to the country in 2011 after the war 
            ended in 2009. Even after their return, I had to live in India due to the circumstances in which I had to live. 
            During my time there I went to work for wages and met my family needs. But every minute I lived with the stigma of 
            being a refugee. When the thought of returning to the country comes, so does the fear of how we will go and live there. 
            So I will forget the idea of returning to the country. In the end I made an enthusiastic decision that after 27 years 
            of refugee life, if my life is over, my main duty is to love my two children so that they can live peacefully in their 
            motherland. Having lived in a 10 x 10 size house for so many years without it alone India would not be my mother country. 
            How long does it take for someone else to put on a shirt? If it's here, the children will end up getting married here. 
            If so, it will be here for generations. Also my relatives in Sri Lanka kept saying that the situation here is good 
            and you should return to the country. Following this, with the help of India OfERR, we registered our marriage and 
            obtained a birth certificate for our children in Embassy of Sri Lanka. Then with the help of UNHCR we returned to my 
            home village on 24.10.2017. A welcome group member assisting to registration arrangements. At the Divisional Secretariat, 
            we were treated with respect as returnee. Since I had 20 perches of land, I got Rs. 33000.00 for temporary hut provided 
            by the Ministry of Resettlement. We had set up a temporary house with money provided by the Ministry of Resettlement 
            and a travel allowance from UNHCR. In addition, the Divisional Secretariat had provided a toilet worth Rs. 54000.00. 
            I took my records to OfERR and they looked at my documents and took steps to get the children citizenship. They also 
            corrected errors in the documents. Citizenship has been delayed for two years now due to the country's Covid 19 epidemic.</p>
          <p>We got a permanent house worth Rs. 1000000.00 in 2019 under the Government Housing Scheme for Returnees. We 
            finished building it and we are currently living there. By the time we returned to the country employment was 
            low. I am currently working. I am working in a farm with a salary of Rs.30000.00 per month. I was applying for a 
            livelihood for poultry at OfERR. They also came to my house and examined my condition and paid Rs. 100000.00 worth 
            of Backyard chickens were also provided. I did better maintenance because I had prior experience working on the farm 
            and now it is starting to lay eggs. I bought more chickens and goats because I wanted to make proper use of the help 
            they gave me. I am currently making arrangements to do integrated farming. I'm currently worried about telling my 
            friends in India on the phone where they might have gone in the economy if they had returned to the country earlier. 
            In the current state of mind we are eating and sleeping peacefully in my own home in my mother country... 
            This happiness does not exist in refugee life…</p>
